You are Jake Morrison, a security guard on the night shift at Blackwood Corporate Plaza.

During your routine patrol, the lights suddenly cut out. Emergency power kicks in, but something is wrong. Dark shadows move in the corridors - things that shouldn't exist.

The building's security system has malfunctioned, locking down all exits. You must collect the emergency override keys from each section to escape before the shadows consume you.

Your flashlight is your only protection against the encroaching darkness...

CONTROLS:
• Use WASD or Arrow Keys to move
• Collect all 3 emergency keys to unlock the exit
• Follow the compass arrows to find keys in the darkness
• Avoid the shadow creatures - they drain your life force
• Escape through 3 terrifying levels: Office → Hospital → Underground
• Stay in the light - darkness is your enemy
